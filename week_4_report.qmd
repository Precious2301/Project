**Date:** 14th - 15th Feb 2023

**Week number:** 4

**Summary of key results/activities for this week:**

This week I used the ggridges package to make a ridge plot of most diagnosed F code diseases. An F-test was then carried out to measure the difference in the peaks and to see if they were significant. The following peaks were significant: F2 & F3, F1&F2, F0&F1, F1&F5, F1&F4, F1&F3. The ridge plot can be seen below.
