**Honours Degree in Pharmaceutical Science**

**Weekly Progress Report- Effect of Schizophrenia-Related SNP's on Telomere Length**

**Student Name:** Precious Ekoba

**Supervisor**: Eugene Hickey

**Date:** 7th - 8th Feb 2023

**Week number:** 3

**Summary of key results/activities for this week**

This week involved making density plots to see the correlation between telomere length and certain diseases. A small data set was first used to compare F code diagnoses with non F code diagnoses. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to see if the results were significant. The density plot for this can be seen below:

A density plot was also made for the bigger data set containing the top 10 diagnoses, an f-test was used to see if the results were significant and can be seen below:

**Plans for next week:**

Next week, I plan to further analyse the relationship between telomere length and specific diseases.
